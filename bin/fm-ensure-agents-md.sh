# Ensure a project worktree follows the agent-memory file convention.
# AGENTS.md is the real project-intrinsic knowledge file; CLAUDE.md points at
# it for compatibility, as a relative symlink when this worktree's git will
# actually materialize one, or as a real regular-file duplicate kept in sync
# otherwise (see claude_symlink_unsafe() below). A duplicate CLAUDE.md carries
# a trailing sync marker so a later run can resync it after AGENTS.md alone
# changes instead of hard-refusing a mismatch it caused itself (see
# claude_has_marker() below). Creates a minimal AGENTS.md skeleton when
# neither file exists, promotes a real CLAUDE.md file when it is the only
# file present, and refuses to clobber distinct real files or wrong symlinks.
# Owns the canonical "## Maintaining this file" self-governance wording for
# project AGENTS.md files, injecting it idempotently into created skeletons,
# promoted CLAUDE.md files, and any existing AGENTS.md that still lacks it.
# Refuses a case-variant real memory file such as a lowercase agents.md, whose
# CLAUDE.md symlink would carry an uppercase literal target that dangles on a
# case-sensitive filesystem (issue #389).
# Never converts an already-real, regular CLAUDE.md into a symlink. Git on
# Windows checkouts commonly runs with core.symlinks=false, where a tracked
# symlink materializes on checkout as a plain text file containing its link
# target rather than a real symlink, so any agent that reads CLAUDE.md
# silently stops seeing project instructions. A project may already have hit
# and reverted exactly that (see the site-feasibility project's
# docs/STATUS.md:187 at the time this was written); re-promoting its real
# CLAUDE.md back into a symlink would reintroduce the same silent breakage,
# so promotion always copies instead, regardless of whether this worktree's
# own filesystem happens to support symlinks.
# This is a worktree utility for crewmates, not a supervision script, so it does
# not call fm-guard.sh.

# Decide whether a CLAUDE.md symlink written in $DIR can be trusted to

# than degrading into a plain-text stub holding the link target (the
# site-feasibility regression described above). Returns success (0 = "true",
# unsafe) when a symlink should NOT be created here. Three independent,
# empirically-checked signals feed this rather than guessing from the path:
#   - git's own effective core.symlinks for this exact repository. Git
#     probes filesystem symlink support at clone/init time and records the
#     result; an explicit "false" is git's own record that it will
#     materialize a tracked symlink here as a plain text file on checkout,
#     so it is trusted outright without a second-guessing probe.
#   - on_drvfs() above: a fresh repo has no core.symlinks recorded yet, and
#     DrvFs itself lets Linux create real symlink objects, so this signal is
#     the only thing that catches a brand-new repo on the captain's own
#     Windows-backed checkouts before the ln -s probe below would otherwise
#     wave it through.
#   - a live filesystem probe: actually create and remove a throwaway
#     symlink in $DIR. This catches worktrees where git has not recorded
#     core.symlinks and this is not a DrvFs mount (a bare `git init` on a
#     plain filesystem with symlinks disabled some other way) and any other
#     reason symlink creation might fail or silently degrade to a regular
#     file.
# Any one signal alone is enough to call it unsafe; all three must pass for a
